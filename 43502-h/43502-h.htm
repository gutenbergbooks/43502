<h2>ACT I</h2>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Hall of Wynnstay House.</span></p>

<blockquote>

<p><em class="direction">Twelve o'clock, Sunday morning, end of June. With
the rising of the Curtain, enter the</em> <span class="character">Butler</span>.
<em class="direction">As he is going, with majestic port, to answer the
door</em> <span class="character">L.</span>, <em class="direction">enter briskly from the garden, by
lower French window</em>, <span class="character">Lady John Wynnstay</span>,
<em class="direction">flushed, and flapping a garden hat to fan
herself. She is a pink-cheeked woman of fifty-four,
who has plainly been a beauty, keeps her
complexion, but is "gone to fat."</em></p></blockquote>

<p><span class="character">Lady John.</span> Has Miss Levering come down yet?</p>

<p><span class="character">Butler</span> (<em class="direction">pausing</em> <span class="smcap">C.</span>). I haven't seen her, m'lady.</p>

<p><span class="character">Lady John</span> (<em class="direction">almost sharply as</em> <span class="character">Butler</span> <em class="direction">turns</em> <span class="smcap">L.</span>).
I won't have her disturbed if she's resting. (<em class="direction">To herself
as she goes to writing-table.</em>) She certainly needs it.</p>

<p><span class="character">Butler.</span> Yes, m'lady.</p>

<p><span class="character">Lady John</span> (<em class="direction">sitting at writing-table, her back to
front door</em>). But I want her to know the moment she
comes down that the new plans arrived by the morning
post.</p>

<p><span class="character">Butler</span> (<em class="direction">pausing nearly at the door</em>). Plans,
m'la<span class="nowrap">&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p><span class="character">Lady John.</span> She'll understand. There they are.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">2</a></span>
(<em class="direction">Glancing at the clock.</em>) It's very important she
should have them in time to look over before she
goes<span class="nowrap">&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<blockquote>

<p>(<span class="character">Butler</span> <em class="direction">opens the door</em> <span class="smcap">L.</span>)</p></blockquote>

<p>(<em class="direction">Over her shoulder.</em>) Is that Miss Levering?</p>

<p><span class="character">Butler.</span> No, m'lady. Mr. Farnborough.</p>

<blockquote>

<p class="right">[<em class="direction">Exit</em> <span class="character">Butler</span>.</p>

<p>(<em class="direction">Enter the</em> <span class="character">Hon. R. Farnborough</span>. <em class="direction">He is
twenty-six; reddish hair, high-coloured,
sanguine, self-important.</em>)</p></blockquote>

<p><span class="character">Farnborough.</span> I'm afraid I'm scandalously early.
It didn't take me nearly as long to motor over as Lord
John said.</p>

<p><span class="character">Lady John</span> (<em class="direction">shaking hands</em>). I'm afraid my
husband is no authority on motoring&mdash;and he's not
home yet from church.</p>

<p><span class="character">Farn.</span> It's the greatest luck finding <em class="direction">you</em>. I
thought Miss Levering was the only person under this
roof who was ever allowed to observe Sunday as a real
Day of Rest.</p>

<p><span class="character">Lady John.</span> If you've come to see Miss
Levering<span class="nowrap">&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p><span class="character">Farn.</span> Is she here? I give you my word I didn't
know it.</p>

<p><span class="character">Lady John</span> (<em class="direction">unconvinced</em>). Oh?</p>

<p><span class="character">Farn.</span> Does she come every week-end?</p>

<p><span class="character">Lady John.</span> Whenever we can get her to. But
we've only known her a couple of months.</p>

<p><span class="character">Farn.</span> And I have only known her three weeks!
Lady John, I've come to ask you to help me.</p>

<p><span class="character">Lady John</span> (<em class="direction">quickly</em>). With Miss Levering? I
can't do it!</p>

<p><span class="character">Farn.</span> No, no&mdash;all that's no good. She only laughs.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">3</a></span></p>

<p><span class="character">Lady John</span> (<em class="direction">relieved</em>). Ah!&mdash;she looks upon you
as a boy.</p>

<p><span class="character">Farn</span> (<em class="direction">firing up</em>). Such rot! What do you think
she said to me in London the other day?</p>

<p><span class="character">Lady John.</span> That she was four years older than you?</p>

<p><span class="character">Farn.</span> Oh, I knew that. No. She said she knew
she was all the charming things I'd been saying, but
there was only one way to prove it&mdash;and that was to
marry some one young enough to be her son. She'd
noticed that was what the <em class="direction">most</em> attractive women did&mdash;and
she named names.</p>

<p><span class="character">Lady John</span> (<em class="direction">laughing</em>). <em>You</em> were too old!</p>

<p><span class="character">Farn.</span> (<em class="direction">nods</em>). Her future husband, she said, was
probably just entering Eton.</p>

<p><span class="character">Lady John.</span> Just like her!</p>

<p><span class="character">Farn.</span> (<em class="direction">waving the subject away</em>). No. I wanted
to see you about the Secretaryship.</p>

<p><span class="character">Lady John.</span> You didn't get it, then?</p>

<p><span class="character">Farn.</span> No. It's the grief of my life.</p>

<p><span class="character">Lady John.</span> Oh, if you don't get one you'll get
another.</p>

<p><span class="character">Farn.</span> But there <em>is</em> only one.</p>

<p><span class="character">Lady John.</span> Only one vacancy?</p>

<p><span class="character">Farn.</span> Only one man I'd give my ears to work for.</p>

<p><span class="character">Lady John</span> (<em class="direction">smiling</em>). I remember.</p>

<p><span class="character">Farn.</span> (<em class="direction">quickly</em>). Do I always talk about Stonor?
Well, it's a habit people have got into.</p>

<p><span class="character">Lady John.</span> I forget, do you know Mr. Stonor personally,
or (<em class="direction">smiling</em>) are you just dazzled from afar?</p>

<p><span class="character">Farn.</span> Oh, I know him. The trouble is he doesn't
know me. If he did he'd realise he can't be sure of
winning his election without my valuable services.</p>

<p><span class="character">Lady John.</span> Geoffrey Stonor's re-election is always
a foregone conclusion.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">4</a></span></p>

<p><span class="character">Farn.</span> That the great man shares that opinion is
precisely his weak point. (<em class="direction">Smiling.</em>) His only
one.</p>

<p><span class="character">Lady John.</span> You think because the Liberals swept
the country the last time<span class="nowrap">&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p><span class="character">Farn.</span> How can we be sure any Conservative seat
is safe after<span class="nowrap">&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<blockquote>

<p>(<em class="direction">As</em> <span class="character">Lady John</span> <em class="direction">smiles and turns to her papers.</em>)</p></blockquote>

<p>Forgive me, I know you're not interested in politics
<em>qua</em> politics. But this concerns Geoffrey Stonor.</p>

<p><span class="character">Lady John.</span> And you count on my being interested
in him like all the rest of my sex.</p>

<p><span class="character">Farn.</span> (<em class="direction">leans forward</em>). Lady John, I've heard the
news.</p>

<p><span class="character">Lady John.</span> What news?</p>

<p><span class="character">Farn.</span> That your little niece&mdash;the Scotch heiress&mdash;is
going to become Mrs. Geoffrey Stonor.</p>

<p><span class="character">Lady John.</span> Who told you that?</p>

<p><span class="character">Farn.</span> Please don't mind my knowing.</p>

<p><span class="character">Lady John</span> (<em class="direction">visibly perturbed</em>). She had set her
heart upon having a few days with just her family
in the secret, before the flood of congratulations breaks
loose.</p>

<p><span class="character">Farn.</span> Oh, that's all right. I always hear things
before other people.</p>

<p><span class="character">Lady John.</span> Well, I must ask you to be good
enough to be very circumspect. I wouldn't have my
niece think that I<span class="nowrap">&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p><span class="character">Farn.</span> Oh, of course not.</p>

<p><span class="character">Lady John.</span> She will be here in an hour.</p>

<p><span class="character">Farn.</span> (<em class="direction">jumping up delighted</em>). What? To-day?
The future Mrs. Stonor!</p>

<p><span class="character">Lady John</span> (<em class="direction">harassed</em>). Yes. Unfortunately we had
one or two people already asked for the week-end<span class="nowrap">&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">5</a></span></p>

<p><span class="character">Farn.</span> And I go and invite myself to luncheon!
Lady John, you can buy me off. I'll promise to
remove myself in five minutes if you'll<span class="nowrap">&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p><span class="character">Lady John.</span> No, the penalty is you shall stay and
keep the others amused between church and luncheon,
and so leave me free. (<em class="direction">Takes up the plan.</em>) Only
<em>remember</em><span class="nowrap">&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p><span class="character">Farn.</span> Wild horses won't get a hint out of me! I
only mentioned it to you because&mdash;since we've come
back to live in this part of the world you've been so
awfully kind&mdash;I thought, I hoped maybe you&mdash;you'd
put in a word for me.</p>

<p><span class="character">Lady John.</span> With<span class="nowrap">&mdash;&mdash;</span>?</p>

<p><span class="character">Farn.</span> With your nephew that is to be. Though
I'm <em>not</em> the slavish satellite people make out, you can't
doubt<span class="nowrap">&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p><span class="character">Lady John.</span> Oh, I don't doubt. But you know Mr.
Stonor inspires a similar enthusiasm in a good many
young<span class="nowrap">&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p><span class="character">Farn.</span> They haven't studied the situation as I
have. They don't know what's at stake. They don't
go to that hole Dutfield as I did just to hear his Friday
speech.</p>

<p><span class="character">Lady John.</span> Ah! But you were rewarded. Jean&mdash;my
niece&mdash;wrote me it was "glorious."</p>

<p><span class="character">Farn.</span> (<em class="direction">judicially</em>). Well, you know, <em>I</em> was disappointed.
He's too content just to criticise, just to
make his delicate pungent fun of the men who are
grappling&mdash;very inadequately, of course&mdash;still <em>grappling</em>
with the big questions. There's a carrying
power (<em class="direction">gets up and faces an imaginary audience</em>)&mdash;some
of Stonor's friends ought to point it out&mdash;there's
a driving power in the poorest constructive policy that
makes the most brilliant criticism look barren.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">6</a></span></p>

<p><span class="character">Lady John</span> (<em class="direction">with good-humoured malice</em>). Who
told you that?</p>

<p><span class="character">Farn.</span> You think there's nothing in it because <em>I</em>
say it. But now that he's coming into the family,
Lord John or somebody really ought to point out&mdash;Stonor's
overdoing his rôle of magnificent security!</p>

<p><span class="character">Lady John.</span> I don't see even Lord John offering
to instruct Mr. Stonor.</p>

<p><span class="character">Farn.</span> Believe me, that's just Stonor's danger!
Nobody saying a word, everybody hoping he's on the
point of adopting some definite line, something strong
and original that's going to fire the public imagination
and bring the Tories back into power.</p>

<p><span class="character">Lady John.</span> So he will.</p>

<p><span class="character">Farn.</span> (<em class="direction">hotly</em>). Not if he disappoints meetings&mdash;goes
calmly up to town&mdash;and leaves the field to the
Liberals.</p>

<p><span class="character">Lady John.</span> When did he do anything like that?</p>

<p><span class="character">Farn.</span> Yesterday! (<em class="direction">With a harassed air.</em>) And
now that he's got this other preoccupation<span class="nowrap">&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p><span class="character">Lady John.</span> You mean<span class="nowrap">&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p><span class="character">Farn.</span> Yes, your niece&mdash;that spoilt child of Fortune.
Of course! (<em class="direction">Stopping suddenly.</em>) She kept
him from the meeting last night. Well! (<em class="direction">sits down</em>)
if that's the effect she's going to have it's pretty serious!</p>

<p><span class="character">Lady John</span> (<em class="direction">smiling</em>). <em>You</em> are!</p>

<p><span class="character">Farn.</span> I can assure you the election agent's more
so. He's simply tearing his hair.</p>

<p><span class="character">Lady John</span> (<em class="direction">more gravely and coming nearer</em>).
How do you know?</p>

<p><span class="character">Farn.</span> He told me so himself&mdash;yesterday. I scraped
acquaintance with the agent just to see if&mdash;if<span class="nowrap">&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p><span class="character">Lady John.</span> It's not only here that you man&oelig;uvre
for that Secretaryship!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">7</a></span></p>

<p><span class="character">Farn.</span> (<em class="direction">confidentially</em>). You can never tell when
your chance might come! That election chap's promised
to keep me posted.</p>

<p><span class="character">Mrs. H.</span> Oh, she's lived abroad. (<em class="direction">Debating with

<p><span class="character">Jean.</span> I don't know how Aunt Ellen came to know
her.</p>

<p><span class="character">Mrs. H.</span> That was my doing. But I didn't bargain
for her being introduced to you.</p>

<p><span class="character">Jean.</span> She seems to go everywhere. And why
shouldn't she?</p>

<p><span class="character">Mrs. H.</span> (<em class="direction">quickly</em>). You mustn't ask her to Eaton
Square.</p>

<p><span class="character">Jean.</span> I have.</p>

<p><span class="character">Mrs. H.</span> Then you'll have to get out of it.</p>

<p><span class="character">Jean</span> (<em class="direction">with a stubborn look</em>). I must have a reason.
And a very good reason.</p>

<p><span class="character">Mrs. H.</span> Well, it's not a thing I should have preferred
to tell you, but I know how difficult you are to
guide ... so I suppose you'll have to know. (<em class="direction">Lowering
her voice.</em>) It was ten or twelve years ago. I
found her horribly ill in a lonely Welsh farmhouse.
We had taken the Manor for that August. The farmer's
wife was frightened, and begged me to go and see what
I thought. I soon saw how it was&mdash;I thought she was
dying.</p>

<p><span class="character">Jean.</span> <em>Dying!</em> What was the<span class="nowrap">&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p><span class="character">Mrs. H.</span> I got no more out of her than the farmer's
wife did. She had had no letters. There had been no
one to see her except a man down from London, a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">28</a></span>
shady-looking doctor&mdash;nameless, of course. And then
this result. The farmer and his wife, highly respectable
people, were incensed. They were for turning the
girl out.</p>

<p><span class="character">Jean.</span> <em>Oh!</em> but<span class="nowrap">&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p><span class="character">Mrs. H.</span> Yes. Pitiless some of these people are!
I insisted they should treat the girl humanely, and we
became friends ... that is, "sort of." In spite of all
I did for her<span class="nowrap">&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p><span class="character">Jean.</span> What did you do?</p>

<p><span class="character">Mrs. H.</span> I&mdash;I've told you, and I lent her money.
No small sum either.</p>

<p><span class="character">Jean.</span> Has she never paid it back?</p>

<p><span class="character">Mrs. H.</span> Oh, yes, after a time. But I <em>always</em> kept
her secret&mdash;as much as I knew of it.</p>

<p><span class="character">Jean.</span> But you've been telling me!</p>

<p><span class="character">Mrs. H.</span> That was my duty&mdash;and I <em>never</em> had her
full confidence.</p>

<p><span class="character">Jean.</span> Wasn't it natural she<span class="nowrap">&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p><span class="character">Mrs. H.</span> Well, all things considered, she might
have wanted to tell me who was responsible.</p>

<p><span class="character">Jean.</span> Oh! Aunt Lydia!</p>

<p><span class="character">Mrs. H.</span> All she ever said was that she was ashamed&mdash;(<em class="direction">losing
her temper and her fine feeling for the innocence
of her auditor</em>)&mdash;ashamed that she "hadn't had
the courage to resist"&mdash;not the original temptation but
the pressure brought to bear on her "not to go through
with it," as she said.</p>

<p><span class="character">Jean</span> (<em class="direction">wrinkling her brows</em>). You are being so
delicate&mdash;I'm not sure I understand.</p>

<p><span class="character">Mrs. H.</span> (<em class="direction">irritably</em>). The only thing you need
understand is that she's not a desirable companion
for a young girl.</p>

<p><span class="character">Mrs. H.</span> (<em class="direction">with a slight grimace</em>). I met her last
winter at the Bishop's. (<em class="direction">Hurriedly.</em>) She's a connection
of his wife's. They'd got her to help with some
of their work. Then she took hold of ours. Your
aunt and uncle are quite foolish about her, and I'm
debarred from taking any steps, at least till the Shelter
is out of hand.</p>

<p><span class="character">Jean.</span> I do rather wonder she can bring herself to
talk about&mdash;the unfortunate women of the world.</p>

<p><span class="character">Mrs. H.</span> Even presumes to set <em>me</em> right! Of
course I don't <em>mind</em> in the least, poor soul ... but I
feel I owe it to your dead mother to tell you about her,
especially as you're old enough now to know something
about life<span class="nowrap">&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p><span class="character">Jean</span> (<em class="direction">slowly</em>).&mdash;and since a girl needn't be very old
to suffer for her ignorance. (<em class="direction">Moves a little away.</em>) I
<em>felt</em> she was rather wonderful.</p>

<p><span class="character">Mrs. H.</span> <em>Wonderful!</em></p>

<p><span class="character">Jean</span> (<em class="direction">pausing</em>). ... To have lived through <em>that</em>

<p><span class="character">Mrs. H.</span> (<em class="direction">rising</em>). Oh, nineteen or thereabouts.</p>

<p><span class="character">Jean.</span> Five years younger than I. To be abandoned
and to come out of it like this!</p>

<p><span class="character">Mrs. H.</span> (<em class="direction">laying her hand on the girl's shoulder</em>).
It was too bad to have to tell you such a sordid story
to-day of all days.</p>

<p><span class="character">Jean.</span> It is a very terrible story, but this wasn't a
bad time. I feel very sorry to-day for women who
aren't happy.</p>

must&mdash;but of course I've always known he doesn't
really like it. It makes him shy. I'm sure it gives
him a horrid twist inside when he sees my name
among the speakers on the placards. But he's always
been an angel about it before this. After the disgraceful
scene he said, "It just shows how unfit women
are for any sort of coherent thinking or concerted

<p><span class="character">Jean.</span> To think that it should be women who've

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">40</a></span></p>

<p><span class="character">Mrs. F.</span> Well, they can't help realising <em>now</em> what
they've done.</p>

<p><span class="character">Miss L.</span> (<em class="direction">quietly</em>). Isn't it just possible they realise
they've waked up interest in the Woman Question so
that it's advertised in every paper and discussed in
every house from Land's End to John o'Groats?
Don't you think <em>they</em> know there's been more said and
written about it in these ten days since the scene, than
in the ten years before it?</p>

<p><span class="character">Mrs. F.</span> You aren't saying you think it was a good
way to get what they wanted?</p>

<p><span class="character">Miss L.</span> (<em class="direction">shrugs</em>). I'm only pointing out that it
seems not such a bad way to get it known they <em>do</em>
want something&mdash;and (<em class="direction">smiling</em>) "want it bad."</p>

<p><span class="character">Jean</span> (<em class="direction">getting up</em>). Didn't Mr. Greatorex say women
had been politely petitioning Parliament for forty
years?</p>

<p><span class="character">Miss L.</span> And men have only laughed.</p>

<p><span class="character">Jean.</span> But they'd come round. (<em class="direction">She looks from

horrid scene, everything was favourable at last.</p>

<p><span class="character">Miss L.</span> At last? Hadn't it been just as "favourable"
before?</p>

<p><span class="character">Mrs. F.</span> No. We'd never had so many members
pledged to our side.</p>

<p><span class="character">Miss L.</span> I thought I'd heard somebody say the Bill
had got as far as that, time and time again.</p>

<p><span class="character">Jean.</span> Oh no. Surely not<span class="nowrap">&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p><span class="character">Mrs. F.</span> (<em class="direction">reluctantly</em>). Y-yes. This was only a
Resolution. The Bill passed a second reading thirty-seven
years ago.</p>

<p><span class="character">Jean</span> (<em class="direction">with wide eyes</em>). And what difference did it
make?</p>

<p><span class="character">Miss L.</span> The men laughed rather louder.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">41</a></span></p>

<p><span class="character">Mrs. F.</span> Oh, it's got as far as a second reading
several times&mdash;but we never had so many friends in
the House before<span class="nowrap">&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p><span class="character">Miss L.</span> (<em class="direction">with a faint smile</em>). "Friends!"</p>

<p><span class="character">Jean.</span> Why do you say it like that?</p>

<p><span class="character">Miss L.</span> Perhaps because I was thinking of a
funny story&mdash;he said it was funny&mdash;a Liberal Whip
told me the other day. A Radical Member went out of
the House after his speech in favour of the Woman's
Bill, and as he came back half an hour later, he heard
some Members talking in the Lobby about the astonishing
number who were going to vote for the measure. And
the Friend of Woman dropped his jaw and clutched
the man next him: "My God!" he said, "you don't
mean to say they're going to give it to them!"</p>

<p><span class="character">Jean.</span> Oh!</p>

<p><span class="character">Mrs. F.</span> You don't think all men in Parliament are
like that!</p>

<p><span class="character">Miss L.</span> I don't think all men are burglars, but I
lock my doors.</p>

<p><span class="character">Jean</span> (<em class="direction">below her breath</em>). You think that night of
the scene&mdash;you think the men didn't <em>mean</em> to play
fair?</p>

<p><span class="character">Miss L.</span> (<em class="direction">her coolness in contrast to the excitement of
the others</em>). Didn't the women sit quiet till ten minutes
to closing time?</p>

<p><span class="character">Jean.</span> Ten minutes to settle a question like that!</p>

<p><span class="character">Miss L.</span> (<em class="direction">quietly to</em> <span class="character">Mrs. Freddy</span>). Couldn't you
see the men were at their old game?</p>

<p><span class="character">Lady John</span> (<em class="direction">coming forward</em>). You think they were
just putting off the issue till it was too late?</p>

<p><span class="character">Miss L.</span> (<em class="direction">in a detached tone</em>). <em>I</em> wasn't there, but I
haven't heard anybody deny that the women waited
till ten minutes to eleven. Then they discovered the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">42</a></span>
policeman who'd been sent up at the psychological
moment to the back of the gallery. Then, I'm told,
when the women saw they were betrayed once more,
they utilised the few minutes left, to impress on the
country at large the fact of their demands&mdash;did it in
the only way left them.</p>

<p>(<em class="direction">Sits leaning forward reflectively smiling, chin

<p>It does rather look to the outsider as if the well-behaved
women had worked for forty years and made
less impression on the world then those fiery young
women made in five minutes.</p>

<p><span class="character">Mrs. F.</span> Oh, come, be fair!</p>

<p><span class="character">Miss L.</span> Well, you must admit that, next day,
every newspaper reader in Europe and America knew
there were women in England in such dead earnest
about the Suffrage that the men had stopped laughing
at last, and turned them out of the House. Men even
advertised how little they appreciated the fun by
sending the women to gaol in pretty sober earnest.
And all the world was talking about it.</p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">49</a></span>
<span class="smcap">Scene</span>: <em>The north side of the Nelson Column in Trafalgar
Square. The Curtain rises on an uproar.
The crowd, which momentarily increases, is composed
chiefly of weedy youths and wastrel old men.
There are a few decent artisans; three or four
"beery" out-o'-works; three or four young women
of the domestic servant or Strand restaurant
cashier class; one aged woman in rusty black
peering with faded, wondering eyes, consulting
the faces of the men and laughing nervously and
apologetically from time to time; one or two quiet-looking,
business-like women, thirty to forty; two
middle-class men, who stare and whisper and
smile. A quiet old man with a lot of unsold
Sunday papers under one arm stands in an attitude
of rapt attention, with the free hand round
his deaf ear. A brisk-looking woman of forty-five
or so, wearing pince-nez, goes round with a pile of
propagandist literature on her arm. Many of the
men smoking cigarettes&mdash;the old ones pipes. On
the outskirts of this crowd, of several hundred, a
couple of smart men in tall shining hats hover a
few moments, single eyeglass up, and then saunter
off. Against the middle of the Column, where it
rises above the stone platform, is a great red
banner, one supporting pole upheld by a grimy<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">50</a></span>
sandwichman, the other by a small, dirty boy of
eight. If practicable only the lower portion of the
banner need be seen, bearing the final words of the
legend</em>&mdash;</p>

<p class="center">"VOTES FOR WOMEN!"</p>

<p class="noi"><em>in immense white letters. It will be well to get, to the
full, the effect of the height above the crowd of the
straggling group of speakers on the pedestal platform.
These are, as the Curtain rises, a working-class
woman who is waving her arms and talking
very earnestly, her voice for the moment blurred
in the uproar. She is dressed in brown serge and
looks pinched and sallow. At her side is the</em>
<span class="character">Chairman</span> <em>urging that she be given a fair hearing.</em>
<span class="character">Allen Trent</span> <em>is a tall, slim, brown-haired
man of twenty-eight, with a slight stoop, an agreeable
aspect, well-bred voice, and the gleaming brown
eye of the visionary. Behind these two, looking on
or talking among themselves, are several other
carelessly dressed women; one, better turned out
than the rest, is quite young, very slight and
gracefully built, with round, very pink cheeks,
full, scarlet lips, naturally waving brown hair,
and an air of childish gravity. She looks at the
unruly mob with imperturbable calm. The</em>

women? It used to be thought unfeminine for women
to be students and to aspire to the arts&mdash;that bring
fame and fortune. But nobody has ever said it was
unfeminine for women to do the heavy drudgery

<p>(<em class="direction">Warming a little to her task.</em>)</p></blockquote>

<p class="noi">Yes, that's almost the first thing we have to learn&mdash;to
get over our touching faith that, because a man tells us
something, it's true. I got to the right court, and I
was so anxious not to be late, I was too early. The
case before the Women's was just coming on. I heard
a noise. At the door I saw the helmets of two policemen,
and I said to myself: "What sort of crime shall I
have to sit and hear about? Is this a burglar coming
along between the two big policemen, or will it be a
murderer? What sort of felon is to stand in the dock
before the women whose crime is they ask for the
vote?" But, try as I would, I couldn't see the prisoner.
My heart misgave me. Is it a woman, I wondered?
Then the policemen got nearer, and I saw&mdash;(<em class="direction">she waits
an instant</em>)&mdash;a little, thin, half-starved boy. What do
you think he was charged with? Stealing. What had
he been stealing&mdash;that small criminal? <em>Milk.</em> It
seemed to me as I sat there looking on, that the men
who had the affairs of the world in their hands from
the beginning, and who've made so poor a business
of it<span class="nowrap">&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p><span class="character">Voices.</span> Oh! oh! Pore benighted man! Are we

is to hale him off to the police-court&mdash;because he had
managed to get a little milk&mdash;well, I <em>did</em> wonder that
the men refuse to be helped with a problem they've so
notoriously failed at. I began to say to myself: "Isn't
it time the women lent a hand?"</p>

a great deal better. We were talking about justice. I
have been inquiring into the kind of lodging the
poorest class of homeless women can get in this town
of London. I find that only the men of that class are
provided for. Some measure to establish Rowton
Houses for women has been before the London
County Council. They looked into the question
"very carefully," so their apologists say. And what
did they decide? They decided that <em>they could do
nothing</em>.</p>

<p><span class="character">Miss L.</span> Why could that great, all-powerful body
do nothing? Because, if these cheap and decent

offered. But the <em>men</em>, I said! Are all who avail

what those of you who read the police-court
news&mdash;(I have begun only lately to do that)&mdash;but
you've seen the accounts of the girl who's been tried
in Manchester lately for the murder of her child. Not
pleasant reading. Even if we'd noticed it, we wouldn't
speak of it in my world. A few months ago I should
have turned away my eyes and forgotten even the
headline as quickly as I could. But since that morning
in the police-court, I read these things. This,
as you'll remember, was about a little working girl&mdash;an
orphan of eighteen&mdash;who crawled with the dead<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">77</a></span>
body of her new-born child to her master's back-door,
and left the baby there. She dragged herself a little
way off and fainted. A few days later she found herself
in court, being tried for the murder of her child.
Her master&mdash;a married man&mdash;had of course reported the
"find" at his back-door to the police, and he had been
summoned to give evidence. The girl cried out to
him in the open court, "You are the father!" He
couldn't deny it. The Coroner at the jury's request
censured the man, and regretted that the law didn't
make him responsible. But he went scot-free. And
that girl is now serving her sentence in Strangeways
Gaol.</p>

<p class="noi">A woman is arrested by a man, brought before a man
judge, tried by a jury of men, condemned by men,
taken to prison by a man, and by a man she's hanged!
Where in all this were <em>her</em> "peers"? Why did men
so long ago insist on trial by "a jury of their peers"?
So that justice shouldn't miscarry&mdash;wasn't it? A<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">78</a></span>
man's peers would best understand his circumstances,
his temptation, the degree of his guilt. Yet there's no
such unlikeness between different classes of men as
exists between man and woman. What man has the

deeds at that time of anguish&mdash;that hour&mdash;(<em class="direction">lowers her

<p><span class="character">Lady John.</span> Then all I can say is I am greatly

<p><span class="character">Lady John.</span> And it <em>isn't</em> so?</p>

<p><span class="character">Miss L.</span> You don't seriously believe a woman
with anything else to think about, comes to the end
of ten years still <em>absorbed</em> in a memory of that

<p><span class="character">Lady John</span> (<em class="direction">astonished</em>). You've got over it, then!</p>

<p><span class="character">Miss L.</span> If the newspapers didn't remind me I
shouldn't remember once a twelvemonth that there
was ever such a person as Geoffrey Stonor in the
world.</p>

<p><span class="character">Miss L.</span> (<em class="direction">smiles grimly</em>). Yes, I'm glad too.</p>

<p><span class="character">Lady John.</span> And if Geoffrey Stonor offered you&mdash;what's

<p><span class="character">Miss L.</span> (<em class="direction">smiles a little contemptuously</em>). Geoffrey
Stonor! For me he's simply one of the far-back links
in a chain of evidence. It's certain I think a hundred
times of other women's present unhappiness, to once
that I remember that old unhappiness of mine
that's past. I think of the nail and chain makers of
Cradley Heath. The sweated girls of the slums. I
think of the army of ill-used women whose very
existence I mustn't mention<span class="nowrap">&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p><span class="character">Lady John</span> (<em class="direction">interrupting hurriedly</em>). Then why

<p><span class="character">Miss L.</span> (<em class="direction">bending forward</em>). Look&mdash;I'll trust
you, Lady John. I don't suffer from that old wrong
as Jean thinks I do, but I shall coin her sympathy into
gold for a greater cause than mine.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">98</a></span></p>

<p><span class="character">Lady John.</span> I don't understand you.</p>

my half-forgotten pain can turn her generosity into
the common treasury<span class="nowrap">&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p><span class="character">Lady John.</span> What do you propose she shall do,
poor child?</p>

<p><span class="character">Miss L.</span> Use her hold over Geoffrey Stonor to

<p><span class="character">Lady John.</span> Help you?</p>

<p><span class="character">Miss L.</span> The man who served one woman&mdash;God

treat any woman as he treated me.</p>

<p><span class="character">Lady John.</span> How will he do that?</p>

<p><span class="character">Miss L.</span> By putting an end to the helplessness of
women.</p>

<p><span class="character">Lady John</span> (<em class="direction">ironically</em>). You must think he has
a great deal of power<span class="nowrap">&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p><span class="character">Miss L.</span> Power? Yes, men have too much over
penniless and frightened women.</p>

<p><span class="character">Lady John</span> (<em class="direction">impatiently</em>). What nonsense! You
talk as though the women hadn't their share of human
nature. <em>We</em> aren't made of ice any more than the
men.</p>

<p><span class="character">Miss L.</span> No, but all the same we have more self-control.</p>

<p><span class="character">Lady John.</span> Than men?</p>

<p><span class="character">Miss L.</span> You know we have.</p>

<p><span class="character">Lady John</span> (<em class="direction">shrewdly</em>). I know we mustn't
admit it.</p>

<p><span class="character">Miss L.</span> For fear they'd call us fishes!</p>

<p><span class="character">Lady John</span> (<em class="direction">evasively</em>). They talk of our lack of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">99</a></span>
self-control&mdash;but it's the last thing they <em>want</em> women
to have.</p>

<p><span class="character">Miss L.</span> Oh, we know what they want us to
have. So we make shift to have it. If we don't, we
go without hope&mdash;sometimes we go without bread.</p>

<p><span class="character">Miss L.</span> Oh, yes, I loved him&mdash;<em>once</em>. It was my

<p><span class="character">Miss L.</span> Oh, being "understood!"&mdash;that's too

<p><span class="character">Miss L.</span> That part of the question doesn't concern

nothing.</p>

<p><span class="character">Lady John.</span> Don't be ungrateful, Vida. Here's Mr.

<p><span class="character">Miss L.</span> I know. And it's not fair. Men suffer as

taught to think the man a sort of demigod. If he tells
her: "go down into Hell"&mdash;down into Hell she goes.</p>

<p><span class="character">Stonor.</span> Make no mistake. Not the woman alone.
<em>They go down together.</em></p>

<p><span class="character">Miss L.</span> Yes, they go down together, but the man
comes up alone. As a rule. It is more convenient so&mdash;for
him. And for the Other Woman.</p>

<p><span class="character">Miss L.</span> Nothing. It was too late to do anything.</p>

<p><span class="character">Stonor.</span> It wasn't too late! You knew&mdash;since

<p><span class="character">Miss L.</span> I had my guilty share in it&mdash;but the
barrier (<em class="direction">her voice trembles</em>)&mdash;the barrier was your

<p><span class="character">Stonor.</span> What name?</p>

<p><span class="character">Miss L.</span> (<em class="direction">very low</em>). The child that was to come.</p>

While I still hoped to get his consent.</p>

<p><span class="character">Miss L.</span> (<em class="direction">nods</em>). How the thought of that all-powerful

it showed me no barrier is so impassable as the one a
little child can raise.</p>

<p><span class="character">Miss L.</span> Yes, it all hung on concealment. It
must have looked quite simple to you. You didn't<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">108</a></span>
know that the ghost of a child that had never seen the
light, the frail thing you meant to sweep aside and

<p><span class="character">Stonor</span> (<em class="direction">his voice held down to its lowest register</em>).
The thing I'm fighting is nothing more than one

not to look to you for some of the things we need
most. If women must be freed by women, we have
need of such as&mdash;(<em class="direction">her eyes go to</em> <span class="character">Jean's</span> <em>door</em>)&mdash;who

it can only be so through the help of men?
What excuse shall you make your own soul for not
going straight to the goal?</p>

<p><span class="character">Miss L.</span> You think we wouldn't be glad to go
straight to the goal?</p>

me and see her revel in a morbid self-sacrifice.</p>

<p><span class="character">Miss L.</span> You say I want to punish you only because,
like most men, you won't take the trouble to
understand what we do want&mdash;or how determined we

Geoffrey, to see a man like you as much deluded as the
Hyde Park loafers who say to Ernestine Blunt,
"Who's hurt <em>your</em> feelings?" Why not realise (<em class="direction">going
quite close to him</em>) this is a thing that goes
deeper than personal experience? And yet (<em class="direction">lowering
her voice and glancing at the door</em>), if you take only
the narrowest personal view, a good deal depends on
what you and I agree upon in the next five minutes.</p>

<p><span class="character">Stonor</span> (<em class="direction">bringing her farther away from the door</em>).
You recommend my realising the larger issues. But
in your ambition to attach that girl to the chariot
wheels of "Progress," you quite ignore the fact that
people fitter for such work&mdash;the men you look to
enlist in the end&mdash;are ready waiting to give the thing a
chance.</p>

<p><span class="character">Miss L.</span> Men are ready! What men?</p>

<p><span class="character">Stonor</span> (<em class="direction">avoiding her eyes, picking his words</em>).
Women have themselves to blame that the question
has grown so delicate that responsible people shrink&mdash;for
the moment&mdash;from being implicated in it.</p>

<p><span class="character">Miss L.</span> We have seen the "shrinking."</p>

<p><span class="character">Stonor.</span> Without quoting any one else, I might
point out that the New Antagonism seems to have
blinded you to the small fact that I, for one, am not
an opponent.</p>

<p><span class="character">Miss L.</span> The phrase <em>has</em> a familiar ring. We have
heard it from four hundred and twenty others.</p>

<p><span class="character">Stonor.</span> I spoke, if I may say so, of some one who
would count. Some one who can carry his party
along with him&mdash;or risk a seat in the Cabinet.</p>

<p><span class="character">Miss L.</span> (<em class="direction">quickly</em>). Did you mean you are ready to
do that?</p>

<p><span class="character">Stonor.</span> An hour ago I was.</p>

<p><span class="character">Miss L.</span> Ah!... an hour ago.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">112</a></span></p>

<p><span class="character">Stonor.</span> Exactly. You don't understand men.
They can be led. They can't be driven. Ten minutes

would throw in my political lot with this Reform.</p>

<p><span class="character">Miss L.</span> And now...?</p>

<p><span class="character">Stonor.</span> Now you block my way by an attempt at
coercion. By forcing my hand you give my adherence
an air of bargain-driving for a personal end. Exactly
the mistake of the ignorant agitators of your "Union,"
as you call it. You have a great deal to learn. This
movement will go forward, not because of the agitation,
but in spite of it. There are men in Parliament who
would have been actively serving the Reform to-day
... as actively as so vast a constitutional change<span class="nowrap">&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

You may not believe it, but now that I understand,
there is almost nothing I wouldn't do to right that

these ten years have taught something to? Why not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">114</a></span>
give even a man credit for a willingness to learn something
of life, and for being sorry&mdash;profoundly sorry&mdash;for
the pain his instruction has cost others? You seem
to think I've taken it all quite lightly. That's not fair.
All my life, ever since you disappeared, the thought of
you has hurt. I would give anything I possess to
know you&mdash;were happy again.</p>

<p><span class="character">Miss L.</span> Oh, happiness!</p>

<p><span class="character">Stonor.</span> You're one of the people the years have
not taken from, but given more to. You are more

<p><span class="character">Miss L.</span> The gods saw it was so little effectual, it
wasn't worth taking away. (<em class="direction">She stands looking out
into the void.</em>) One woman's mishap?&mdash;what is that?
A thing as trivial to the great world as it's sordid in
most eyes. But the time has come when a woman
may look about her, and say, "What general significance
has my secret pain? Does it 'join on' to anything?"
And I find it does. I'm no longer merely a
woman who has stumbled on the way. I'm one (<em class="direction">she
controls with difficulty the shake in her voice</em>) who has
got up bruised and bleeding, wiped the dust from her
hands and the tears from her face, and said to herself
not merely, "Here's one luckless woman! but&mdash;here is
a stone of stumbling to many. Let's see if it can't be
moved out of other women's way." And she calls
people to come and help. No mortal man, let alone a
woman, <em>by herself</em>, can move that rock of offence.
But (<em class="direction">with a sudden sombre flame of enthusiasm</em>) if
many help, Geoffrey, the thing can be done.</p>
